# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Game: Blackjack

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program let users play Blackjack against computers. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Apart from the game itself, the program also records the user's win rate. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game itself and the win rate system

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Draw some turtles after each game

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Maybe add an funtion to allow an cheat mode for user? For example, user can choose whether they can see the next card in the deck. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Find out how to make each card only show up once. I think maybe random.shuffle could be easier than using random for each card. With random.shuffle, I can just let the next card show up without reducing any card in the deck.
