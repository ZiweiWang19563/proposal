# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Risk parity

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program let users get optimal weight of each asset in a portfolio, based on risk parity strategy.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Get the standard deviation, returns for each assets, then calculate the covariance among them. By making each asset's risk contribution to the portfolio the same to get the optimal weight for each asset.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The data reading. The asset's returns and risks. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Get the optimal weights.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Be able to imply this program to any excel sheet.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
New skills: import tools like scipy and numpy
Topics need to research: risk parity strategy, Quadratic programming in python
