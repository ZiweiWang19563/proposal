# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to write a program to make user play blackjack with computers. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

The member I collaborate with is Hau Chak Kai

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I'm wondering how many computers should the player play against and what can I do with turtle in this proposal. Also I'm considering should I add a win rate system to record player's total gameplays and wins so that player can see his performance. 

Another question is how to remove a card from the deck since each card could only show up once. I plan to make the deck a list and use list.remove() to realize that.
